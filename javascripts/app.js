// SPA Layout

// Every "page" in a section
// Title page, click anywhere to continue
// First page, next button on right side
// Second page on, previous and next buttons

// The previous button should execute immediately
// The next button should perform a check to make sure
//	something has been selected

// Maybe give all the buttons that move forward the same class?
